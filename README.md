This is a combination of a five data samples that use a known mass to simulate a control system with different operating frequencies in terms of the natural frequency, with four data samples having different magnitudes of complex poles, and one data sample with only real poles in the control system. The main code 'lab2' naps the step response of in each case with and image in 'Capture.PNG'.
